# NFL-Predictions
Utilizes NFL.com/stats/ date converted to an csv format and then calculates the passing/rushing offensive and defensive ratings of 2 teams. Based off of those ratings a winner is chosen, and based off the difference in ratings a rough estimate of how many points the winner will win by is also given. 

Compares two teams at a time, feel free to try different teams by their abbreviations. NE = New England Patriots etc.
